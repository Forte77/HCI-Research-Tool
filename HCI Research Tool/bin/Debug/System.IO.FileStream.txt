          "Content": "Prediction For AVENGERS 4 Plot Line

The movie starts off right where the first post credit scene of Ant-Man And The Wasp ended where Hank, Hope and Janet got dusted by Thanos’s snap and Scott is stuck in the quantum realm. He goes to the time thing that Janet told him about, and he gets sucked through time and arrives back on the building he was on before he went into the quantum realm to see the van and all of Hank’s equipment is still there and no one has touched it. He then goes and finds Cassie and find that she’s grown up and is a super hero, and that he’s been gone for 5 years.
Scott then goes and finds Tony, Hawkeye and Nebula on earth and they explain what Thanos did and what happened to everyone. Scott then tells them that the quantum realm matter can allow them to travel through time and different realitys, but they need a device to power it up. Tony decides that he wants to make a new gauntlet like Thanos so that they can undo what Thanos did and so that they have equal power to fight Thanos.
So then they go to Wakanda to find that all of the people that survived the Wakanda battle in Avengers Infinity War is living there and M’Baku is the king since T’Challa dusted. Also Valkyrie, Korg and Miek and the remaining Asguardians are living in Wakanda as well. And Thor and Valkyrie are in a romantic type of relationship. Tony then tells everyone that he wants to make a gauntlet like Thanos’s so that they can undo what Thanos did and have equal power to defeat them. And Scott tells them that they can travel to different realitys using the quantum energy he has, but they need a device so that they can travel. So Tony, Banner and Shuri create these wristbands with the quantum energy and they can travel through different realitys.
Then Thor takes Tony and Rocket and goes to Nivedalir and ask Etri to make another gauntlet to challenge Thanos. Etri agrees and Thor again holds the ring open and lets the heart of the dying star create the gauntlet. Then they take the gauntlet back to earth to meet the others.
Thanos then senses within the stones about what the avengers are doing and he becomes held bent on stopping them. He then goes after the avengers.
Then the Avengers bump into Captain Marvel and explain their plan to her and she agrees.
Banner then comes to terms with Hulk and they merge together to form the proffessor Hulk which is the Hulk’s body and strength and Banner’s mind.Then Tony, Scott, Steve, and Banner travel back to the battle of new york in the first avengers movie but in another reality. Steve finds his counterpart and steals his clothes and shield. Tony disguises himself as a shield member and steals the tesseract and Loki’s scepter from past Thor and Loki. He takes them to the others and Banner uses Hulk’s strength and breaks the tesseract open to get the space stone and Steve breaks open the scepter and gets the mind stone. They then put the stones in the gauntlet and travel to another reality.
Thor, Rocket, Captain Marvel and Valkyrie start to recruit an army to challenge Thanos and his army. They recruit Wong who survived the snap and he comunicates with Doctor Strange who is stuck in the soul stone with the others who fell to the snap. They also recruit the eternals from the eternals movie and Cassie Lang and Peper Potts who becomes Rescue and other powerful beings.
Then Nebula joins Tony, Steve, Scott, Banner to Morag in a different reality. When they get there Thanos arrives and tells the Avengers that he knows what they are doing and says that if they keep trying he will kill them all. The avengers don’t listen and they have a big fight with Thanos, and they barely get the power stone and get away and jump to another reality. Banner then breaks the orb open and puts the power stone in the gauntlet. Then they travel again but Thor and his party join them to Asguard before it was destroyed and get the reality stone from the warriors three before they can take it to the collector. They put the reality stone in the gauntlet. They then travel to another reality.
Thanos has communications with Gamora in the soul world in the soul stone.
They then travel to another reality to get the time stone, they arrive when Doctor Strange is fighting Dormamu by replaying the same moment over and over again “Dormamu I’ve come to bargain.” Thanos arrives and he and Dormamu team up and fight the avengers right there. Before Thanos and Dormamu can defeat defeat them, timeline altercations restore Mjolnir from being destroyed by Hela and Steve weilds it against Thanos and blows Thor away but he’s not dead. Thanos then kills Steve and Mjolnir gets loss in space and time. The remaining avengers then steal the eye of Agamotto from Doctor Strange and they travel to another reality while Dormamu takes over that reality’s earth. Thanos also escapes as well.
Nebula then tells the other avengers that the soul stone is on Vormir and they have to sacrafice what they love for it, a soul for a soul.They go to Vormir and meet Red Skull. Thanos and his army arrives to stop the avengers from getting the soul stone. Then the remaining avengers and Thor’s army arrives to help fight. Part of it is M’Baku and what’s left of the Wakanda army and a species of powerful creatures. Then a huge battle starts between both armies. Hawkeye protects the unfinsihed gauntlet from Thanos’s minions. Tony then sacrafices Rhoady for the soul stone when it seems that Thanos and his army are winning. Tony gets the soul stone, and then snaps his fingers and all of the people that died from the snap appears on Vormir. Spider-Man, Star Lord, Drax, Mantis, Groot, Black Panther, Wanda, Doctor Strange, Falcon, Hope, Janet, Hank EX: Tony and Peter have an emotional reunion, as well as Rocket and Groot and the other guardians, as well as Scott and Hope. Then Tony leads all the avengers and the entire army in a charge at Thanos and his army with his gauntlet. Thanos kills Hawkeye right in front of Black Widow, Banner/Hulk have a rematch with Thanos, Thanos defeats Banner/Hulk again but in a much closer fight than in Avengers Infinity War. Captain Marvel and Thanos have a 1 on 1 fight, but Thanos wins. Tony and Thanos have a 1 on 1 fight with both gauntlets. At a last ditch effort Tony sacrafices himself to defeat Thanos by trapping him in the soul world in the gauntlet Thanos was wearing. As Tony lay dying on the ground Pepper and Spider-Man are comforting him, both of them are crying. Pepper tells Tony that his dream was real and that she was pregant. Tony said he knows it’s a boy and tells Pepper to name him Steve. Pepper agrees. Tony tells Spider-Man to always be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Spider-Man agrees. Tony then passes away. Doctor Strange then takes the gauntlet Thanos was wearing and snaps his fingers to wipe everyone elses memory of the snap execpt the avengers that survived. Gamora is brought out of the soul world because of Doctor Strange. Gamora reunites with the other guardians And the gauntlet takes it back to the time right before Thanos snapped his fingers like it never happend. Strange explains that the gauntlet the avengers made and collected the stones from different realitys were sent back to where they were before they took them. The guardians then go back into space as well as the army.
Then there is a huge funeral for Tony as he is buried right by his parents, all the avengers that survived are there. Afterwards Thor, Valkyrie, Korg and Miek take all the remaining Asgardians to Norway to build a new Asgard. Thor also keeps Stormbreaker. Black Panther and his people go back to Wakanda. Black Widow then leave the Avengers and goes her own way to set up her solo movie. Captain Marvel becomes leader of the new Avengers. Scott, Hope, Janet, Hank and young Cassie go back to their lives. Bannner/Hulk goes back to Sakar and becomes king there. Doctor Strange and Wong take the Infinity Gauntlet and Wanda back to the Sanctum. As the movie is about to end, Spider-Man sees on the tv that a mysterious person with a fish bowl helmet on his head is robbing banks, so he puts on his Spider-Man costume and swings across buildings and the scene cuts to black.
The end credit scene then shows Nick Fury in Cabin sitting by a table. Black Widow then comes in and tells Fury that she left the Avengers and wants nothing to do with the Avengers. Fury tells Black Widow this has nothing to do with the Avengers. Fury then grabs a file and throws it on the desk, and on it says X-MEN initiative. Fury then tells Black Widow, “Can you keep a secret?” Then it cuts to black.
The scecond end credit scene happens, where Bucky is seen walking up to a table and sees Steve’s shield there on it. Buck then picks it up and cuts to black.
The third end credit scene shows Mjolnir crash landing on a planet, then a horse-like man comes up to it and picks it up and it’s revealed that it’s Beta Ray Bill, then it cuts to black and ends.",

Only reason it failed is because they're trying to compete with marvel by coming out with big movies instead of the smaller connected films to help introduce the characters. By throwing in all of the characters right off the bat without any context gave them a mess of a story. Universal again tried cashing in on their connected universe idea by making a Monster Universe, but they threw too much in as well and got similar results as DC.", "Likes": "0",}

Not at all - the joker character is awesome ...but some incarnations of him fall under the “cookie cutter laughing all the time loon” ...

example:

the Cesar Romero Joker campy and stupid - laughs at just about anything

The joker character is great (if portrayed correctly) ...heath ledgers take on joker was great. He laughed hysterically for SPECIFiC reasons (for example - when Batman was interrogating him and beating the crap out of him - his laughter there was used to display the chaos he embodied which fit the character well)

Some cases I have in mind of when lunatic laughter is overused would be:

black panther with Ulysses Klaw
